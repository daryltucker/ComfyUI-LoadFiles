# LoadFiles

The primary goal of these nodes is to provide a way to access files generated by ComfyUI workflows, local to the machine running ComfyUI.  These nodes should always return an updated list of files when triggered.

### General Inputs

1. directory
    * The directory in which you want search files
1. limiter
    * Regular Expression to 'limit' or filter the files selected
1. sort
    * Attribute by which to sort the selected files
    * Name, Date Created, Date Modified, Size
1. direction
    * Accending or Decending sorting by `sort` attribute.
1. splice
    * Use the Head or Tail of sorted files
    * You will likely want to use Tail with Accending, or Head with Decending
1. count
    * The number of files to return
    * If fewer than `count` files are found, we re-use existing files to fill the count
    * A count of 0 will return all files
1. error
    * No Error - Does not error if `count` is not met
    * Load Count - Error if `count` is not met

### General Outputs

1. filenames (STRING)
   * Newline delimited list of files selected


## ListFilenames
> Provide list of Files form Directory

This is supposed to be a generic node which allows you to use the core functionality of LoadFiles, with uncommon or new scenarios.


## LoadImages
> Load Images from Directory

In addition to selecting files and returning the list of files, this will load up the images and provide an IMAGE and MASK output.

> Note: Mask might not be working correctly at the moment
